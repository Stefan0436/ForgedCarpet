Todo:
Fix sponge support
Fix other mod incompatibilities
Classpath prioritizing (inspired by VanillaFIX, own code however)
Task to generate local keystore and fingerprint information
Task to connect with a keystore and save the information (use prompts for passwords)
Automatically set SHA1 fingerprint variable after signJar
Add the keystore setup to the compiling guide
Find new versions of coreMod and mappingType (shadowjar)
Test mod in new 1.12
Fix bugs caused by port
Fix as many warnings as i can
Script to generate patch diff's (by using the versions of the mod, or by using commit ids)

VERY IMPORTANT: Test BlockInfo
Test all commands
Command output status (success, information, etc)

Make my own tweaks

Later: port to 1.13.x (v1.3.0 - 1.13, far future, first tweak the mod even more)
Later: port to 1.14.x (v1.4.0 - 1.14, far future, first tweak the mod even more)
Later: port to 1.16.x (v1.5.0 - 1.16, far future, first tweak the mod even more)
