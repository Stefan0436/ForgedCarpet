## Compiling guide (not yet working, code needs to be ported):
1. Clone the git repo.
2. Change directory to the cloned repo.
3. Run the following command depending on your os:
- Windows: `./gradlew.bat genEclipseRuns build eclipse`
- Linux: `./gradlew genEclipseRuns build eclipse` (remember to mark gradlew as executable: chmod ug=rwx gradlew)
4. the jar will be saved in the build/libs folder.

## Development Environment Setup Guide (This is for Eclipse, i recommend you to use version 2019-09, because i could not get the project loaded on the version 2020â€‘09)
- Skip to step 4 if you already compiled the jar before.
1. Clone the repo.
2. Change directory to the cloned repo.
3. Run the following command depending on your os:
- Windows: `./gradlew.bat genEclipseRuns eclipse`
- Linux: `./gradlew genEclipseRuns eclipse` (remember to mark gradlew as executable: chmod ug=rwx gradlew)
4. Create a new workspace (in a different folder than the mod folder)
5. If you have the welcome page open, click 'Workbench' in the top right corner.
6. Press the keys: ALT+F
7. Click Import
8. Open the category 'Gradle' and select 'Existing Gradle Project'
9. Click next until you get to the import page.
